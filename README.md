CricApp Web App
Welcome to the CricApp Web App repository! This web application allows you to get real-time cricket match scores and updates using the Cricbuzz API from Rapid API. The app is built using React, Tailwind CSS, HTML, JS, and JSX.
Local Setup
To set up the project locally and work on the latest branch (new fixes), follow the steps below:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cricApp
cd cricApp/my-app/src

Install dependencies: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, install the project dependencies.
npm install

Configure Rapid API Key: Sign up for Rapid API and get the Cricbuzz API key. You'll need to add this key to the appropriate API calls in the code. Look for places where API calls are made and replace 'YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY' with your actual API key.

Run the development server: Now, you can start the development server to see the app in action.
npm start
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000.
